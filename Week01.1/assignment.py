# Assignment operator
a = 6   # Assign value
b = a   # Assign the expression to the Left operand
print(b) # prints 6

# Adition Assignment Operator
x = 6
y = 3
x += y
print(x) # prints 9

# Substraction Assignment Operator
x -= y # x is now 9, y is 3
print(x) # prints 6 (9 - 3)

# Multiplication Assignment Operator
x *= y # x is 6, y is 3
print(x) # prints 18

# Division Assignment Operator
x /= y # x is 18, y is 3
print(x) # prints 6

# Floor Division Assignment Operator
x //= y # x is 6, y is 3
print(x) # prints 2

# Modulus Assignment Operator
x %= y # x is 2, y is 3
print(x) # prints 2

#Multiplication Assignment Operator
x **= y # x is 2, y is 3
print(x) # prints 8
